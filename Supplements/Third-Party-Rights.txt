Supplement to Open Source Policy Template

Third-party rights


1 Background

Activities relating to goods or services of any kind may be restricted to a
certain extent because external parties may have rights to them. This applies
whether or not these rights are directly apparent. The most important
third-party rights are

- Copyright
- Patent rights
- Trademark rights

Although all these rights can be grouped under the term "third-party rights",
they are defined by significantly different characteristics. In particular,
copyright law differs in a number of important ways from other third-party
rights. All of the above mentioned third-party rights potentially apply to
software, especially if it is used in industry applications: If a machine is
run by a sophisticated computer program, the manufacturer might want to protect
the software itself through copyright, the method for controlling the machine
through patents, and if the software should be sold or otherwise marketed, a
trademark could be registered.

This supplement of the OSADL Open Source Policy Template aims to provide an
overview of the various aspects of third-party rights that may play a role when
creating and distributing products and to compare the third-party rights with
each other. Unlike the other supplements, which all refer to terms that are
more or less related to copyright, this supplement takes a look more at third
party rights in general of which copyright is only one part.

Scope

Copyright

Copyright in the EU is governed by a number of European legislative acts, which
harmonize copyright throughout the member countries (On an international level,
international agreements such as the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works) ensure common grounds for copyright protection and
common grounds for minimal standards of copyright protection. Copyright applies
to a variety of works, e.g. literature, music and visual arts. Computer programs
i.e. source code and object code (Including preparatory design material see Art.
1 para 1 Software Directive (2009/24/EC), available at
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32009L0024) are
considered literary works (See Art. 1 para 1 Software Directive) and are
therefore subject to copyright. Computer programs may also be combined works
including e.g. visual artwork (video sequences in computer games, elements of
graphical user interfaces).

The author of the work has exclusive rights to the work, including but not
limited to reproduction of the work (copies in any manner or form),
translations, adaptations and arrangements, to perform the work in public or to
communicate it to the public. However, exceptions to these exclusive rights
might apply; some exceptions are related to the contextof use (such as in
education or research), to freedom of speech (right to citations, where
applicable), or related to the protected subject matter.

The latter often is the case with computer programs: Sometimes, restricted acts
such as the creation of copies, translations or adaptations are necessary in
order to use the program or to inspect its proper functioning, or to correct
errors in the program that prohibit normal use. If this is the case, these acts
do not require authorization if the person performing these acts legally
acquired the program i.e. has the right to use the program (See Art. 5 Software
Directive). Moreover, one may perform acts of decompilation (including
reproduction of the code and translation of its form) of the relevant part of a
computer program, if decompilation is necessary to obtain information about the
program that is needed to achieve interoperability with other computer programs
(See Art. 6 Software Directive).

Copyright law is concerned with making verbatim copies of a work or parts of it
and distributing them. It always only protects embodiments of an author's
idea, never the idea itself. For example, if someone describes a functionality
of how a computer program might work, anybody is free to develop a computer
program that implements that principle. On the other hand, the term also
includes formal changes in the work, such as translating a novel into another
language, reproducing a painting in a different size, or playing a piece of
music on an instrument other than the one for which it was originally intended.
All of the latter would constitute a copyright infringement if it were done
without a valid license or an applicable exception.

Patent right
In contrast to copyright, patent law is concerned with protecting patented
processes or material. It is particularly important that the scope of a patent
is not limited to the way the process was exemplified in the patent
application. For example, a solution to a technical problem may have been
described in a particular computer language, but this does not mean that the
patent can be circumvented if the method is implemented in another computer
language. All implementations of the method, regardless of how they are
implemented in detail, are protected.

Hence, a particular patent may be violated by two or more different computer
programs each of which is protected by copyright. Copyright protection and
patent protection can therefore coexist independently.

*******************************************************************************
Example:
To illustrate the difference between copyright and patent law, a Linux-based
embedded system will serve as an example, and it is assumed that a copyrighted
subroutine of the Linux kernel implements a patented method. It is further
assumed that a mechanism has been implemented to disable the execution of the
patented method, and in one particular case, this mechanism is used to disable
it before it was even executed. This approach most probably protects the user
from patent infringement as the patented method is not used. If the kernel code
was later distributed including the copyrighted subroutine, it would still
constitute copyright infringement if a valid copyright license was not obtained.
*******************************************************************************

Trademark right
Trademark rights grant the holder of such a right the exclusive use of certain
words or figurative marks in connection with products of certain categories.
Trademarks provide information about the origin of the product, which is also
relevant in the context of FOSS: A trademark can provide valuable hints as to
whether software has been developed and tested by a large number of people or
companies (e.g. RedHat Linux) as opposed to a non-trademarked project which
might as well be a fresh fork by a single developer.

Trademark infringement may occur when the marks are used on a product that
falls within the registered product category or when they are otherwise used in
a trademarked manner, such as in promotional materials. However, trademark
infringement requires usage of the trademark in commercial trade as a means of
differentiation from competitors or in a way that impairs the trademark's
indication-of-origin function. Moreover, using someone else's trademark in
connection with one's own goods or services also constitutes trademark
infringement as this use encroaches upon the indication-of-origin function
(e.g. a developer creates a new operating system and brands it as RedHat Linux
in order to boost credibility and acceptance).

Contrary to the above, no infringement occurs if the use of the trademark
happens outside of a business or commercial context, or to merely denote or
describe a product or company.


Registration and expenses

Copyright

One of the peculiarities of copyright law is that it does not require
registration or formal marking of the work to indicate that it is protected by
copyright. Instead, the mere act of creating a work leads to it being protected,
as set forth in the Berne Convention. Consequently, works such as

- a written, spoken, or sung sequence of words,
- a computer program source code and object code,
- a work of art such as a painting, sculpture, or installation,
- or a movement such as a dance or ballet performance

that were created by a human being, can be perceived by a human being and are
sufficiently complex (This refers to the standard of originality criteria, which
differs in various jurisdictions. Especially for computer program source code,
the minimum standard is quite low: "no tests as to the qualitative or aesthetic
merits of the program should be applied", see Software Directive recital 8. In
addition, Art. 1 para 3 states: "A computer program shall be protected if it is
original in the sense that it is the author's own intellectual creation. No
other criteria shall be applied to determine its eligibility for protection.")
may not be copied, edited or distributed without a valid license from the
copyright holder if no exception (see above) applies. Copyright protection ends
when a certain time after the death of the author (or of the last author in case
of co-authored works) has passed (Member countries of the Berne Convention agree
to provide at least 50 years of protection after the author's death.). In the
EU and in the US, copyright protection ends 70 years after the death of the
author (Protection might be shorter for some categories of works).

Since there is no mandatory registration, there are of course no registration
fees, so copyright protection is free of charge.

Patent right
If an inventor wants to protect an invention to prevent anyone from using the
invented process and to obtain the right to charge a royalty for the use of the
process, the inventor must register the patent. Such patent application is
relatively expensive because it is usually helpful to seek advice of a patent
attorney to go through the patenting process, and after patenting, an increasing
yearly patent fee must be paid to the patent office. Moreover, patent protection
has to be sought in each country in which the inventor or patent holder desires
protection. Therefore, multiple applications might have to be filed, requiring
patent expertise in various countries.

An invention needs to be patentable, i.e. fulfill a number of requirements in
order to be granted a patent in the EU (Other requirements might apply outside
of the EU): It must qualify as an invention in a field of technology and be of
technical character, it must be employable for industrial application, it must
be new and it must involve an inventive step (An exhaustive guide can be found
in the European Patent Office's "Guidelines for Examination", available at
https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/guidelines.html). Moreover, the
invention must be one that is not excluded from patent protection such as mere
discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, schemes, rules and
methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business and
computer programs if the computer program does not have a technical character.
Also, the invention may not be contrary to morality or "ordre public" or be a
"method for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and
diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body".

If patent protection is sought for software, it must have a technical character
in that it has a "further technical effect" other than being a computer program
(This is a frequent subject of debates since one could argue that there is
nothing of more technical character than any computer program). For example, a
computer program which controls an ABS system in a car has a technical
character and would most likely be patentable, whereas a text editor most
likely would not.

Trademark right
Companies that have built up a brand that may be seen by customers as an
indication of certain qualities can register the word and figurative mark at a
trademark office. Other companies may then be prevented from using the
trademark or similar marks on their products and from profiting from its good
reputation. Registering a trademark is less costly than registering a patent,
the fee does not increase over time, and the registration can be renewed
without a time limit.

Validity

Copyright
Copyright is not limited to the country where the creator of the work lives,
but can be enforced in all countries that are signatories of the (Berne
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works) and have
implemented the standards of the convention into national law. By the beginning
of 2022, 180 countries have done so; only 19 countries have not yet done so,
but 13 of them have joined the TRIPS Agreement (Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights), which includes recognition of the
Berne Convention standards.

As a result, in countries that are members of the Berne Convention, national
copyright protection is granted to works distributed in that country
irrespective of the author's nationality or country of residence due to Art.
5 Berne Convention ("Authors shall enjoy, in respect of works for which they are
protected under this Convention, in countries of the Union other than the
country of origin, the rights which their respective laws do now or may
hereafter grant to their nationals, as well as the rights specially granted by
this Convention.", Art. 5 para 1 Berne Convention.).

Patent right
A patent application is usually limited to one country or, e.g. in the case of
the EU, to a union of countries. It is, of course, possible to apply for the
invention to be patented in more than one country, which is regularly the case.
However, inventors usually limit themselves to countries where a large number of
potential users can be assumed. If the applicant is no longer able to pay the
patent fee, or if the patent protection has expired after the legally
stipulated period of validity, e.g. 20 years, anyone in that territory can use
the invented process just as unrestrictedly as in countries where an
application has never been filed.

Trademark right
As with patent law, a trademark can be registered in a specific country, in
many countries, or in a group of countries. Protection is granted only in the
territory for which the trademark was registered. In addition, a trademark is
granted only for certain classes of products. Some countries, namely the U.S.,
require that products bearing the trademark are actually used in the country
and that such use can be proven.

Trademarks need to be used to maintain protection (in many countries, the time
limit after which trademark protection expires if it is not being used is five
years). Trademark protection starts with registration and usually ends after ten
 years. However, protection can be extended infinitely by paying additional
fees.

Detection of violations

Copyright
Normally, it is the sole responsibility of the copyright holder to look for
infringement and take appropriate action, as there is no state agency
responsible for doing so. In the case of FOSS license violations, the copyright
holder might for example discover license violating code in a GitHub repository
which she could then use as evidence in court. However, if the infringement
occurs in a closed source or a proprietary software project, or in a
Software-as-a Service setting, it might be a lot harder to prove copyright
violations since the person claiming copyright usually has no access to the
source code or object code. If the copyright holder has established
infringement, a lawyer is required to draw up a cease-and-desist letter or, if
this does not help, to take the infringer to court. If the court case is
unsuccessful, certain costs must be borne by the copyright holder; otherwise, of
course, court and attorney fees will be reimbursed by the losing party.

Patent right
Same as with copyright, it is the sole responsibility of the holder of a patent
right to look for infringement and take appropriate action, as there is no
state agency responsible for doing so (State agencies such as the patent offices
will, however, conduct research before a patent is granted, making it less
likely that a patent is being infringed by a new patent.). Normally, the advice
and assistance of a patent attorney is required to defend the patent in the
event of infringement.

Trademark right
Trademark infringements are punishable by law, at least in the case of
commercial infringement. In addition, trademark holders can investigate
infringements on their own initiative and take infringers to court. It should
also be pointed out here that holders of trademark rights cannot simply
generously overlook infringements, since infringers may then argue that the
holder has lost interest in the mark. In consequence, it may become more
difficult for the holder to defend the trademark.

Automation of violation detection

Copyright
Since copyright is about copying works or part of them in verbatim form,
automatic detection of unlicensed copies by means of software based analysis
initiated by the rights holder is in theory relatively easy, especially when
infringing material is carelessly made available on the Internet. The visual
media company (Getty Images, Inc.), for example, continuously scans the
Internet for media and compares them to the approximately 200 million assets it
owns. Once material is found that meets the company's criteria for copyright
infringement, a fully automated computerized process is set in motion to draft
a cease-and-desist letter and send it to the infringer along with an invoice
for past use of the material. The same applies to embedded systems for which
firmware updates are made available on the Internet. Authors of FOSS that is
often used in such firmware can automatically determine whether their code is
included and check whether the license obligations are correctly fulfilled. If
this is not the case, the authors can take action against them.

Patent right
Since the patent application describes a technical process in words and the
actual implementation usually is an object or process (unless it is, for
example, a music codec), it is hard to search for it in a completely automated
way. At most, it is possible to use computers to search accompanying documents
of devices, such as instruction manuals, and look for suspicious terms, which
again is easily feasible as long as the documents are publicly available on the
Internet. Typically, however, a company must acquire and analyze the suspect
product to prove patent infringement. In addition to these procedures, a patent
holder can monitor new patent applications and intervene when a patent
application is filed that may infringe an existing patent because there is an
application process for patents. Powerful patent search engines exist for this
purpose.

Trademark right
Trademark infringements might be observed on the internet as well - e.g. in
online shops or on video streaming platforms, where sellers might use foreign
trademarks to advertise their products. Therefore, trademark infringement
violation detection could also be automated in the online context, whereas it
might be more difficult with "offline infringements". However, as with patents,
the registration of new trademarks can be monitored and efforts may be made to
prevent the registration of identical or similar trademarks with overlapping
product categories.
