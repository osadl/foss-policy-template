Contribution permission


Before any of our employees can contribute to a FOSS project, they must request 
and obtain a contribution permission by completing one of the forms at the end 
of this document. The first form grants a one-time permission for a specific 
contribution while the second form grants a universal contribution permission 
for a specific project. To grant a contribution permission, a signatory of our 
company must sign this form.
========================================
Apart from the specified contribution permissions (one-time and general for a 
specific project) it might also be considered to grant a general permission to a 
specific contributor.
========================================

Below, some explanations are given on the required information.

- Developer: Full name of the developer to whom the right is granted to 
contribute the specified software to the specified FOSS project under the 
specified license in the name of our company

- Department: Full name and or abbreviation of the company department the 
developer belongs to

- Software components to be contributed: Specific software components that are 
intended to be contributed; only required for a one-time contribution permission

- Software project: The full name of the FOSS project

- License(s): SPDX Identifier(s) of the license(s) under which the contributed 
code will be published

- Repository: URL of the repository or the shared Internet folder where the 
software will be made available

- Mailing list: URL and email address of the corresponding mailing list where 
code snippets, comments, ideas, proposals, reviews etc. are exchanged

- Start of validity of the permission: Date; only required for a general 
contribution permission

- End of validity of the permission: Date or ”until further notice”; only 
required for a general contribution permission

- Internal review: Must be specified whether required or not and, if so, by whom

- Signed-off-by: Name <email>: Name and email address to be used in the 
Signed-off-by: tag of a commit message.
========================================
This is particularly important, since many FOSS projects require this tag and 
understand that the person who signed it takes full responsibility that a 
contribution permission was granted and that the code does not contain 
procedures or works that are known to be protected by third-party rights. The 
given name must be the name of a natural person, however, it may be a good idea 
to provide an email address of the related department such as 
software@company.tld to ensure that a knowledgeable person can be contacted in 
the event that the developer has left the company.
========================================

- Signatures: Person(s) authorized to sign documents on behalf of our company 
must sign this contribution permission as we hold the exclusive rights of use of 
the specified software to be contributed. To accept the permission the developer 
must also sign.
