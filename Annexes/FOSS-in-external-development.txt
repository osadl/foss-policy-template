FOSS in external development

When commissioning an external party (e.g. freelancer, supplier) to develop
software that includes FOSS, it must be ensured that the external party adheres
to the required standards of FOSS compliance. A template for the related
sections of a contract with an external party is given below.

============================================================================
Please note that the proposed wording of the texts given in this document are
general templates that must be reviewed by a company's legal counsel before
they can be used.
============================================================================

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This contract rules the handling of FOSS in the context of software developed
by the external party and COMPANY. All software delivered to COMPANY under
this contract by the external party is hereafter referred to as "Software
Product".

1. Aim
The provisions laid out in this contract aim to ensure that the Software
Product delivered by the external party can be copied and distributed in
compliance with the applicable licenses by COMPANY.

2. Scope
The provisions laid out in this contract apply to the entire Software Product.
The provisions of this contract shall prevail within their scope over our other
contracting conditions and the General Terms and Conditions of the external
party.

3. Definition
3.1 Free and Open Source Software ("FOSS") for the purpose of this contract
is software the license of which meets the requirements of the "Open Source
Definition" (https://opensource.org/osd) of the Open Source Initiative and/or
is registered in the publicly accessible lists of Free Licenses and Open Source
Licenses of the Free Software Foundation and/or the Open Source Initiative,
respectively.

3.2 The provisions laid out in this contract apply accordingly to software that
is dedicated to the Public Domain by the copyright holder.

4. Verification and information obligations of the external party
The external party shall be aware that non-compliance with the license
obligations for FOSS may result in aviolation of copyright law, and thus, in
defects of title of the Software Product. The external party alone is
responsible for meeting the license conditions of all FOSS that is included in
the Software Product. This also applies to embedded systems as well as firmware
updates and any other software distribution.

The external party must check any pre-existing software that is included in the
Software Product for FOSS. This applies accordingly for software that the
external party received from their suppliers. The external party commits to
comply with the standard for Open Source License Compliance, ISO 5230, i.e. the
current OpenChain Standard Version (2.0 or later) (See
https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/_media/openchain/openchainspec-current.pdf).

===============================================================================
If the contracting party wishes to offer assistance to the external party to
implement the OpenChain standard, e.g. by offering access to the contracting
party's own FOSS policy and/or by offering use of their compliance tooling
infrastructure to the external party, the following text passages can be
included. If so, please check that all requirements of the applicable data
protection law are complied with.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If desired, the external party has the right to get access to COMPANY'S FOSS
policy and/or the tooling infrastructure implemented in our company to achieve
compliance.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
===============================================================================

5. FOSS documentation
At the latest with delivery of the Software Product the external party must
provide COMPANY with

- a "Bill of Material" ("BOM"), a list of the used FOSS components,
corresponding version number and respective FOSS licenses as SPDX identifier
(https://spdx.org/licenses/) including all dependencies, and

- a document for the compliance with the FOSS licenses ("Open Source Content
Documentation") which contains all license texts and copyright notices with
regard to the respective files in Debian DEP-5 format
(http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/), or SPDX
format (https://spdx.org/spdx-specification-21-web-version) or other
standardized format and additionally all further information that must be
provided when distributing the software according to the applying licenses, and

- the complete and corresponding source code of FOSS contained in the Software
Product.

6. Use of copyleft licenses
6.1 The external party must ensure that copyleft-licensed software is used in
the Software Product only in a way that does not bear the risk that COMPANY
must license own software and/or third party software components as FOSS when
used in combination with the Software Product without having obtained a prior
approval from COMPANY for this purpose. Copyleft licenses are FOSS licenses
that contain the requirement to license all or defined modifications of the
software or software combinations as FOSS when the modifications or software
combinations are redistributed or used by third parties.

6.2 The external party ensures that the license conditions of all software
components linked with FOSS licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License allow any user of the software modification of these software
components and reengineering for debugging such modifications.

6.3 The external party ensures that COMPANY will be provided with all
necessary information required to enable the customer to perform compilation
and reinstallation of FOSS licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License, the GNU General Public License and the GNU Affero General Public
License (if applicable), especially in case the product is an embedded system.

7. Guarantee
The external party guarantees that the Software Product does not violate any
third-party copyrights and that the license conditions of all FOSS and
third-party software are complied with.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2. Contributing externally developed software to a FOSS project
In case the software developed by the external party is intended to be licensed
under a FOSS license and contributed to a FOSS project or published as a new
FOSS project, there are different scenarios of how to handle the rights on the
created software. The following templates can be added to the general contract
on FOSS in outsourced development given above.

- Rights remain with the external party
Ownership in the copyrights of the developed software remain with the external
party. The work contract stipulates that all software is licensed under the FOSS
license agreed-upon by all parties in advance and either contributed to a
public repository or delivered to the customer directly.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The external party will retain the copyright ownership for all software
developed as part of this contract. They will license all such software under
the specified FOSS license(s). They will ensure that no third-party rights are
violated by this licensing, in particular with respect to patents and
compatibility of all involved FOSS licenses.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Credit
Rights remain with the external party, but the company is credited in the file
headers. In this case, the template wording of KeepRights will be extended by
the following addition:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The external party agrees to place the following acknowledgment within the file
headers of all software developed as part of this contract.

Support by COMPANY is gratefully acknowledged.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
============================================================================
Please note that most FOSS licenses do not require such an acknowledgment to be
delivered along with a binary distribution of the software. If this is desired,
the acknowledgment should be included in the copyright notice.
============================================================================

- Repository
Rights remain with the external party, but the software is licensed under a
specified FOSS license and published on a specified repository. In case the
software is contributed to an existing project, the external party additionally
goes through the contribution process until the contribution is accepted. In
this case, the template wording of KeepRights can be extended by the following
addition:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The external party agree to contribute the software developed as part of this
contract to the specified repository or FOSS project. This includes following
the project's contribution process and integrating any required changes until
the contribution is accepted.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In case the software is released as a new FOSS project, the external party is
commissioned to maintain the repository and take care of contributions from
third parties. In this case, the template wording of KeepRights can be extended
by the following addition:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The external party agree to publish the software developed as part of this
contract on the specified repository. In addition, they will maintain the
published software for number of years. This includes reviewing and integrating
contributions from third parties, tracking security issues and updating the
software accordingly.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- All rights are transferred (software buyout)
The work contract stipulates that the copyright ownership is transferred
entirely to the customer on delivery of the software.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(1) The external party shall grant COMPANY all economic rights in the software
which the external party creates for the purpose of fulfilling the contractual
relationship. With regard to the rights of use, COMPANY shall thus be provided
with the same rights as if the software had been created in an employment
relationship pursuant to Section 69b) (1) German Copyright Act. COMPANY is
authorized to transfer the acquired rights of use and/or to grant non-exclusive
rights of use thereto, in particular to publish the software under any open
source license and to license it to all third parties.

(2) At the request of the developers involved, these may be named as authors in
the source code, with the external party using copyright and author notices
according to the following syntax:

Copyright (c) [year] COMPANY, authors: [name of author optional]

The external party shall ensure that the source code contains the copyright
notices of the developers who wish to be named, at the time the software is
supplied to COMPANY.

(3) If the external party uses pre-existing FOSS in the development of the
software, a complete list of the used FOSS with the following information shall
be provided upon delivery of the software:

- Name and version of the FOSS,
- FOSS license(s) as SPDX identifier (https://spdx.org/licenses/) and a
- license information document for the distribution of the software to
third parties.

This license information document shall contain all FOSS license texts and
copyright notices of the used FOSS. The external party shall ensure that the
license compatibility of the FOSS used in the software is maintained.
Alternative to the previous sentence: COMPANY wishes to offer the software
under the following FOSS license: name of FOSS license (e.g. GNU General Public
License, Version 3). The external party shall ensure that only such
pre-existing FOSS is used which has licenses compatible with name of FOSS
license (e.g. GNU General Public License, Version 3).

(4) The software shall be delivered in source code form with documentation and
the FOSS license information document.

(5) Additional option: Notwithstanding paragraph, COMPANY shall not acquire
any exclusive rights to the software components in Annex A, but shall rather be
granted the perpetual, worldwide and unrestricted non-exclusive, irrevocable
right to exploit the software in any known and unknown way and to reproduce,
distribute, adapt and make the software available to the public and to
sublicense it to this extent. The paragraphs shall apply accordingly; the
external party shall be named as copyright owner in the copyright notice.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

===========================================================================
For software buyouts where contract law of a country from outside the EU
applies - in particular in the US - the wording of a buyout clause will be
different. The following text can give some reference points on what needs to be
 considered. Please note that the wording in particular of the text given below
is a proposal that must be reviewed by a company's legal counsel before it can
be used.
===========================================================================

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, external party hereby
grants to COMPANY a worldwide, royalty-free, exclusive, perpetual and
irrevocable license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of
non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, under the
Copyright covering the software to use the software by all means, including,
but not limited to:

- publish the software,
- modify the software,
- prepare derivative works based upon or containing the software and/or to
combine the software with other programs,
- reproduce the software in original or modified form,
- distribute, to make the software available to the public, display and
publicly perform the software in original or modified form.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
