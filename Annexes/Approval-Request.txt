Approval request


This document details the information and material that must be collected to 
submit an approval request for a third-party software component (”Candidate for 
Use”). A Candidate for Use is eligible for an approval request when it has gone 
through our company’s -> ”Approval process” and the outcome indicates so. The 
information must be entered into the form supplied at the end of this document 
and must be submitted to the LD.

Information and material to submit

- Intended use: Since third-party software that is merely used in-house may be 
treated differently from software that is intended to be copied and distributed 
to customers, it is important to specify the intended use of the Candidate for 
Use.

- Software package name and version number: The correct name of the software 
package and the version number must be specified. If it is already predictable 
that in the foreseeable future other version numbers may apply, they must be 
given.
########################################
Option 1: A separate approval request must be submitted when the software is 
upgraded to a new version.
########################################
Option 2: All versions are approved as long as there is no license change.
########################################

- URL of the related software project: Some software projects maintain a home 
page that displays more general information of the software with background 
information to licensing including answers to frequently asked questions with 
respect to licensing. This is particularly important, since the authors or 
holders of rights of a software have an important say with respect to the 
license and interpretation of the same.

- License name: Licenses have a distinguishable name, such as ”Common 
Development and Distribution License 1.0” which must be given here. If 
available, the SPDX Identifier (https://spdx.org/licenses/) shall be used.

- Type of license: The license type must be specified, if this is possible in 
advance: i.e. FOSS (listed in the catalog of Open Source licenses maintained by 
the Open Source Initiative (OSI, https://www.opensource.org)) or other.

- Original license text: If the license is not listed by OSI, the original 
license text must be attached to the approval request. OSI listed licenses 
fulfill the requirements of the Open Source Definition (OSD, 
https://www.opensource.org/osd). Other licenses must be classified individually.

- Type of integration: This item relates to the way the Candidate for Use will 
be integrated into a system, if any. This is important, since FOSS licenses 
differ with regard to obligations imposed on a derivative work (see Supplement 
-> ”What is copyleft?”). Therefore, it should be specified here whether the 
software to be approved is stand-alone or whether it is combined with other 
third-party or in-house developed software. This has implications on whether the 
compatibility of involved licenses needs to be considered. There are various 
ways software components can interact, such as being statically or dynamically 
linked, as plugins, as kernel modules, through other interfaces, etc. For 
details see Supplement -> ”What is a derivative work?”

- Type of linkage: Not all copyleft licenses request that the same license must 
be used for any combined work, but may mitigate this obligation in such a way 
that another license may be used, if the software components are linked at 
compile or run time, can be separated at any time later on and the customer can 
individually replace components by another version of choice. Such licenses are 
called FOSS license with weak copyleft. It is therefore important to 
differentiate the way of how the components are linked to each other and whether 
they can be separated and relinked later on.
========================================
Copyleft licenses with and without restrictions are given as part of the -> 
”OSADL Open Source License Obligations Checklists” project.
========================================

- List of software components to which the Candidate for Use will be linked, if 
any: A complete list of all software components to which the Candidate for Use 
will be linked must be given here to allow a license compatibility check. In 
addition, for every such component the applicable license must be specified. If 
approval is granted and software components are listed here, the approval is 
limited to either stand-alone use or when linked to one of the listed 
components.

- List of software components that the Candidate for Use requires at link or run 
time, if any: Some software packages are dependent on other software components 
such as language libraries. A complete list of all software components that the 
Candidate for Use requires at link or run time must be given here. In addition, 
for every such component the applicable license must be specified and a separate 
approval must have been obtained.

- Attachments with respect to linkage and separability, if any: It sometimes 
may be difficult to decide which components are linked together and whether they 
can be separated later on – particularly, if a component recursively depends on 
other components. In this case, a callgraph and/or a list of unresolved symbols 
must be created and attached to this request (A tool to create such a call graph 
by analyzing ELF files is available in its original version at
https://github.com/armijnhemel/compliance-scripts/tree/master/elfgraphs
and as extended version made by OSADL at https://git.osadl.org/ckresse/callgraph).

- Requester’s contact data: Finally, the contact data of the requester must be 
given in case explanations of the provided information are needed.
