Outsourcing FOSS development

When commissioning an external party (e.g. freelancer, supplier) to 
develop software that is licensed as FOSS, there are different scenarios of how 
to handle the rights on the created software:

- Rights remain with the external party: All rights of the developed software remain with the external party. 
The work contract stipulates that all software is licensed under a particular FOSS 
license and either contributed to a public repository or delivered to the 
customer directly. The responsibility for the software (e.g. 
third-party rights, patents) remains with the external party.

- All rights transferred: The work contract stipulates that all rights of use are transferred to the 
customer on delivery of the software, i.e. the copyright notices must be 
adapted accordingly. The company then publishes the software under a FOSS 
license on their repository. Note: The work contract should also clarify if an 
author attribution is desired.

- Credit: Rights remain with the external party but the company is credited in the 
file headers (e.g. "funded by company").

- Repository: Rights remain with the external party but the software is published on the 
companyâ€˜s repository. In addition, the external party is commissioned to 
maintain the repository and take care of contributions from third 
parties.Who is responsible for the published software? 
(Guess: The company is responsible because they own the repository and thus 
copy and distribute the software.)
